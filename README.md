reFocus is a reimaging of the original Focus skin released in 2008 for XBMC Mediacenter and was created from the ground up. Although visually there are a lot of differences it shares the same philosophy as it's predecessor. Which is to provide a clean, minimalistic and smooth user experience, putting your media at the center of your experience.
